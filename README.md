# UCseek
The model UCseek, based on genome-wide methylation data, using the methylation information and copy number information of samples to build a model that can be used for non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of low-grade and high-grade urothelial carcinomas of tumors as well as early and advanced tumors, even at extremely low sequencing depths.
