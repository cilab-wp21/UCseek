# The uploaded files are the sample files used in the methylation model script for reference only
#UCseek pipline
(1) CNV model value
First step：
python varbin.py sample_name.bam ./sample_name ./sample_name-stat
Second step：
Rscript varbin.R
#The file with suffix.nobad.varbin.data.txt is obtained, and the lowratio column is extracted as the input value of the copy number model.
Third step：Calculate the copy number model marking value
#Get the copy number score of the sample
Rscript cnv_model_value.R
（2）methylation model value
#An example is generated to illustrate the methylation model

first step：
Rscript parameter of estimation.R
Second step:
Rscript probability of read.R
Third step:
Rscript combine_data.R
Fourth step:
Rscript tumor_fraction.R
#Get the methylation model score of the score
(3) UCseek score
Script calculate_UCseek.R
